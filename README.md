## ⚡ Current Challenge  

Right now, the **TestBuddy module** shows incorrect results (always `0` output) even for correct code.  
I suspect it’s because the **code is not compiling/executing against test cases**.  
👉 Any insights or solutions are highly welcome!  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  

- Add **real code execution engine** for TestBuddy  
- Gamification (leaderboards, streaks)  
- Multi-language support  
- AI-powered personalized study plans
